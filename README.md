# 🔄 PARALLEL EXECUTION MODEL (Minion Efficiency Framework™)

To maximize throughput, work is intentionally split across **independent but synchronized streams**.

| Stream   | Focus                | Dependencies               | Status |
| -------- | -------------------- | -------------------------- | ------ |
| Stream A | Scraping & ingestion | External website stability | 🟢     |
| Stream B | Backend APIs         | DB schema                  | 🟡     |
| Stream C | Automation design    | API contracts              | 🔴     |
| Stream D | Frontend UX          | API readiness              | ⚪      |

> **PM Note:**
> No stream is allowed to idle. If blocked, Minions must produce documentation, spike solutions, or write TODOs.

# 🧍 DAILY STANDUP (Living Section)

### 🗓️ Standup Format

Each Minion answers **exactly** the following:

* **What did I complete yesterday?**
* **What will I complete today?**
* **What is blocking me (if anything)?**

---

## 📆 WEEKLY EXECUTIVE UPDATE (For People Who Don’t Code)

### 🗓️ Week [X] Update

**Overall Health:** 🟡
**Confidence Level:** High (Minions remain compliant)

---

### ✅ What Was Accomplished

* Content scraping completed
* Database schema finalized
* Backend foundation established

---

### 🔄 What’s In Progress

* CRUD API completion
* API contract stabilization for Phase 2

---

### 🚨 Risks & Mitigations

| Risk              | Status | Action          |
| ----------------- | ------ | --------------- |
| Scraper fragility | Low    | Monitoring      |
| API changes       | Medium | Versioning plan |

---

### 🎯 Focus for Next Week

* Complete Phase 1
* Unlock Phase 2 development
* Begin LLM prompt experimentation

---

# 📊 METRICS, BECAUSE FEELINGS DON’T SCALE

* Articles ingested: **5 / 5**
* APIs completed: **2 / 4**
* Blockers unresolved >24h: **0**
* Parallel streams active: **4**

---

## 🧠 PM COMMENTARY (Internal, Not for Minions)

* Scope intentionally segmented to reduce coupling
* Phase 2 complexity justified by leverage potential
* Frontend deprioritized until automation proves value

---

## 🏁 FINAL WORD FROM GRU

This project is managed with:

* Clear ownership
* Relentless updates
* Parallel execution
* Minimal sympathy

The system is working.
The Minions are productive.
The content will be optimized.

😈
